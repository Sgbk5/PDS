1. Design the three steps of a reproducible process based on the following table, taking into account the work that can be done at each stage    and the folder structure (reference study case in chapter 3).

[raw_frailty_data.csv] https://github.com/Sgbk5/PDS/blob/c74a41b9217b287659b120d2216b22e5a18e8fc1/PDS/Q1/data_raw/Frailty.csv

2. Use the student performance dataset provided in the link below to complete 5 data visualization assignments (make 5 unique visualizations). Describe whatever type of analysis each visualization has made simpler. Make this question's folder structure resemble that of question 1.
